\"complete anything\"; is an in-buffer completion framework.
Completion starts automatically, depending on the values
`company-idle-delay' and `company-minimum-prefix-length'.

Completion can be controlled with the commands:
`company-complete-common', `company-complete-selection', `company-complete',
`company-select-next', `company-select-previous'.  If these commands are
called before `company-idle-delay', completion will also start.

Completions can be searched with `company-search-candidates' or
`company-filter-candidates'.  These can be used while completion is
inactive, as well.

The completion data is retrieved using `company-backends' and displayed
using `company-frontends'.  If you want to start a specific backend, call
it interactively or use `company-begin-backend'.

By default, the completions list is sorted alphabetically, unless the
backend chooses otherwise, or `company-transformers' changes it later.

if the filename is incomplete, but there's only a single file in the current project
